# Vacancy data analysis project

## Description

This project is a comprehensive exploration of Python job vacancies, divided into two distinct parts: Web Scraping and Data Analysis.

The web resource: https://djinni.co 

In the Web Scraping phase, I utilized Selenium to extract information from Python job vacancies listed on Djinni. It's important to note that only publicly available information was gathered, and the data collected will not be used for commercial purposes. Using Selenium, I successfully implemented a parsing mechanism to retrieve key details for each vacancy, including the vacancy title, company name, job description, location, salary, and published date.

The Data Analysis segment involved conducting exploratory data analysis on the gathered information. I delved into the job descriptions and titles, extracting essential insights for a comprehensive understanding. The extracted data was then visualized to provide a clearer representation of trends, patterns, and relevant information within the Python job market.

## Examples of Visualization:

### Visualize Candidate level
